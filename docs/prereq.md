## Environmental pre-requisites

Accounts and programs you will need to have.

### A Google or Gmail account

At the start of the PKS Fundamental course, the instructor will grant
you access to a Google Cloud Platform project that is managed by
Pivotal.  You will need a Gmail account in order to accept the invite.

### Chrome or Firefox

Some apps we will be using may be less compatible with Internet Explorer
or Safari.  To ensure a smooth experience, we recommend that you use
either [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/).

### PuTTY (Windows only)

If you are using windows, you will need a way to log in to a remote
Linux server.  PuTTY is a common tool for doing this.  You can download
it from [their 
website](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
